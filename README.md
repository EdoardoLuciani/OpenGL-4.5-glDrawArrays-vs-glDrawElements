# OpenGL-4.5-glDrawArrays-vs-glDrawElements

This repository aims to illustrate the differences in glDrawArrays and glDrawElements. Both the .cpp files use the same shaders, the only difference between them is which drawing function is used. The official documentation for both the functions can be found here: https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glDrawArrays.xhtml
